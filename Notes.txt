* Time.deltaTime : we use it because some devices are faster than others.
********************************
* components in Unity have 2 different name for the component (not all of them):
the one with 2D at the end of it is where we are working with a three dimensional object and the other one is when work with sprites.

Update
Timing: The Update method is called once per frame. It is the most commonly used method in Unity for handling any 
kind of game logic that needs to be checked or updated regularly.
Use Case: Update is typically used for most general game logic, including:
Reading player input (e.g., checking if a key is pressed)
Moving characters or objects (e.g., applying movement based on input)
Running timers or countdowns
Checking conditions (e.g., health checks, status updates)
Execution Order: All Update methods across all scripts are called before any LateUpdate methods are called in 
the same frame.

LateUpdate
Timing: The LateUpdate method is also called once per frame, but it is called after all Update methods have
 been called. This makes it ideal for tasks that need to occur after the regular update cycle has completed.
Use Case: LateUpdate is generally used for:
Following or positioning cameras (e.g., making sure the camera updates its position after the player has moved)
Final adjustments to object states (e.g., correcting positions or applying final transformations)
Performing tasks that depend on other objects having updated first
Execution Order: All LateUpdate methods are called after all Update methods. If you need to ensure that a piece
of logic is applied after other updates, LateUpdate is the place to do it.
